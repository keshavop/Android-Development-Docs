Localization in Android
The applications that we use in Android devices can be specific
to a particular language. That is where Localization comes in the role.

Localization is a process that changes the string into various different
languages based on user requirements.

Android loads text and media resources from the project’s ‘res’ directory.
Additionally, Android can select and load resources from different directories, based on the current device configuration and locale.

For example, if the code loads a string called ‘R.string.title’,
Android will choose the correct value for that string at runtime by loading the appropriate strings.xml file from a matching ‘res/values’ directory.

In order to have a multilingual Android app you need to provide Android with
the localized resource files.

Language Localization is a process to change the application context into
multiple languages based on the requirements.

Android is an overall operating system that runs on millions of devices worldwide
and among various groups. Since the diversity range is enormous, a feature that facilitates local languages adds an advantage to any Android application. Implementation of such a feature requires the need to handle text, audio files, numbers, currency,
and graphics appropriately for the locals where our application is used.

Language	Code	Folder Name
